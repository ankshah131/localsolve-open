# LocalSolve Open Source Repository

## Building this website locally

This website codebase uses `uv` and `mkdocs`. To get started (assuming you have `uv` installed):

- clone this repo and `cd` into it
- run `uv run mkdocs serve` to set up the environment and run the development server

This project also uses `pre-commit` which you can optionally run locally (though not required as it's run in the cloud anyway).
