# Resources

Here is a list of great resources for you to level up your software skills. These resources are less technical - focusing on the technology from a scientist's point of view, rather than that of a computer scientist.

_The list is roughly sorted from most widely applicable at the top, to least widely applicable at the bottom._

<!-- If the resource is paid, put `ðŸ’°` at the beginning of the resource title. -->

- [Earth and Environmental Data Science course book](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro), by Ryan Abernathey
- [Python for Data Analysis, 3E by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)
    - A practical guide for scientists, teaching essential Python skills, pandas, and NumPy for efficient data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Wes McKinney is also the creator of [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), the "go to" package for data analysis in Python.
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
    - Software Carpentry is a lesson program - geared towards researchers - equipping individuals with essential data and computational skills. Courses include:
